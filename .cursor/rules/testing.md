# Testing Standards and Practices

## Testing Philosophy
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) where appropriate
- Continuous Integration testing
- Shift-left testing approach
- Security-first testing mindset

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Fast execution time
- Deterministic results

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Test external service integration
- Test database operations
- Test network operations
- Test concurrent operations
- Test failure scenarios

### Security Tests
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Fuzzing tests
- Key management tests
- Transaction security tests
- Network security tests

### Performance Tests
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Endurance testing
- Scalability testing
- Resource usage testing
- Network latency testing

### Functional Tests
- End-to-end testing
- User journey testing
- API testing
- UI testing
- Cross-platform testing
- Regression testing

## Cryptocurrency-Specific Testing

### Wallet Testing
- Key generation tests
- Address validation tests
- Transaction creation tests
- Fee calculation tests
- Balance management tests
- Backup/restore tests

### Lightning Network Testing
- Channel opening tests
- Payment routing tests
- Channel closure tests
- Error handling tests
- Network reconnection tests
- State recovery tests

### Network Testing
- Mainnet simulation tests
- Testnet integration tests
- Network failure tests
- Peer connection tests
- Block synchronization tests
- Mempool interaction tests

## Test Environment

### Test Data
- Use appropriate test fixtures
- Mock sensitive data
- Use realistic test scenarios
- Clean test data after use
- Version control test data
- Document test data requirements

### Test Tools
- pytest as test runner
- pytest-cov for coverage
- pytest-asyncio for async tests
- pytest-mock for mocking
- pytest-benchmark for performance
- pytest-xdist for parallel execution

### Continuous Integration
- Automated test execution
- Test environment setup
- Test result reporting
- Coverage reporting
- Performance metrics
- Security scan results

## Test Documentation

### Test Plans
- Test objectives
- Test scope
- Test approach
- Test schedule
- Resource requirements
- Risk assessment

### Test Cases
- Clear description
- Prerequisites
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results
- Pass/fail criteria

### Test Reports
- Test execution summary
- Test coverage report
- Issue summary
- Performance metrics
- Security findings
- Recommendations

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Follow coding standards
- Use type hints
- Document test code
- Review test code
- Maintain test code
- Refactor tests as needed

### Test Organization
- Logical test structure
- Clear naming conventions
- Group related tests
- Separate test types
- Maintain test independence
- Clean test setup/teardown

### Test Maintenance
- Regular test review
- Update tests with code changes
- Remove obsolete tests
- Improve test coverage
- Optimize test performance
- Document test changes

## Updates
This document should be reviewed and updated quarterly or when significant changes are made to the testing strategy.

### Prompt 1: Project Setup and Environment Initialization

```text
# Prompt 1: Project Setup and Environment Initialization

Your task is to set up the project scaffolding for the Bitcoin Multisig POC. Follow these steps:

1. **Folder Structure and Version Control**
   - Create the root folder named `BarqHWMuSig`.
   - Inside `BarqHWMuSig`, create the following folders:
     - `config/` (for environment configuration files)
     - `docs/` (for documentation; include the spec file as `spec.md`)
     - `src/` with subfolders:
       - `bitcoin_transaction/`
       - `device_integration/`
       - `cli/`
       - `common/` (for shared utilities like logging and exception handling)
     - `tests/` (for unit and integration tests)
     - `demo/` (for demo scripts)
   - Confirm that Git is initialized in the root folder (assume it is already initialized).

2. **Environment and Dependency Management**
   - Initialize a `pyproject.toml` file in the root folder using uv as your package manager.
   - Add dependencies for the following packages:
     - `python-bitcoinlib`
     - `yubikey-manager`
     - `fido2`
     - `pyusb`
     - `btchip-python`
     - `cryptography`
     - `Click`
     - `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `coverage`
     - `python-dotenv`
   - Ensure that the Python version is explicitly stated as 3.14.

3. **Configuration File**
   - In the `config/` folder, create a standard `.env` file that will store environment variables.
   
Document your setup steps and verify that the folder structure and dependency management are complete. End this prompt by confirming that all scaffolding has been set up, as this will serve as the foundation for further development.

### Prompt 2: Implementing Common Utilities – ConfigLoader and Logger

```text
# Prompt 2: Implementing Common Utilities – ConfigLoader and Logger

Your next step is to build the common configuration and logging utilities, located in `src/common`.

1. **ConfigLoader**
   - Create a Python module named `config_loader.py` in `src/common/`.
   - Implement a `ConfigLoader` class that:
     - Reads configuration from the `.env` file using python-dotenv.
     - Exposes a method to return configuration values as a dictionary or object.
   - Ensure that errors (e.g., missing configurations) are properly logged and raised.

2. **Logger**
   - Create a Python module named `logger.py` in `src/common/`.
   - Implement a `Logger` class or function (`setup_logger`) that:
     - Configures logging with levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
     - Sets up logging to output to the console.
   
3. **Testing**
   - Write minimal unit tests (using pytest) for both `ConfigLoader` and `Logger` to ensure:
     - The `.env` file is read correctly.
     - Logging is configured and logs messages as expected.

At the end of this prompt, confirm that the common utilities are implemented, tested, and ready for integration with the other modules.

```text
# Prompt 3: Building the Bitcoin Transaction Management Module – Part 1: MultisigWallet

Now, develop the first part of the Bitcoin Transaction Management module in `src/bitcoin_transaction/`.

1. **MultisigWallet Class**
   - Create a module named `multisig_wallet.py`.
   - Implement a class called `MultisigWallet` with the following stub methods:
     - `create_wallet()`: Initializes a multisig wallet.
     - `generate_address()`: Generates a 2-of-3 multisig address.
     - `list_keys()`: Returns the public keys involved.
   - Include proper logging and error handling in each method.

2. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests in `tests/test_bitcoin_transaction.py` for the `MultisigWallet` class to validate:
     - Initialization of the wallet.
     - Address generation returns a valid multisig address (you can use a stubbed response).
     - Listing keys returns the expected key structure.

Ensure that these implementations are minimal, test-driven, and ready to be integrated with the rest of the Bitcoin transaction management components.
```

     - `create_transaction()`: Build a raw transaction.
     - `estimate_fees()`: Estimate fees for the transaction.
     - `build()`: Assemble transaction details.
     - `sign()`: Aggregate signatures from devices.
     - `broadcast()`: Send the transaction to the network.
   - Include detailed logging and error handling for each step.

2. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests (in `tests/test_bitcoin_transaction.py`) that verify:
     - A transaction can be created and built.
     - Fee estimation returns a valid value.
     - The sign and broadcast methods handle error conditions appropriately.

Make sure these methods are stubbed for now, with clear interfaces that allow for incremental implementation.

### Prompt 5: Building the Bitcoin Transaction Management Module – Part 3: TransactionMonitor

```text
# Prompt 5: Building the Bitcoin Transaction Management Module – Part 3: TransactionMonitor

Complete the Bitcoin Transaction Management module by implementing the `TransactionMonitor` in `src/bitcoin_transaction/`.

1. **TransactionMonitor Class**
   - Create a module named `transaction_monitor.py`.
   - Implement a class called `TransactionMonitor` with the following methods:
     - `monitor_transaction()`: Poll the blockchain or simulate polling for transaction updates (mempool entry, confirmations, errors).
     - `log_event()`: Log significant lifecycle events.
   - Ensure that events are clearly logged with contextual information.

2. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests in `tests/test_bitcoin_transaction.py` that simulate transaction lifecycle events and verify that:
     - `monitor_transaction()` correctly triggers status updates.
     - `log_event()` records events as expected.

Ensure that these components are integrated with the previous modules so that the transaction management module is fully testable.

# Prompt 8: Implementing the CLI Module Using Click

Develop the command-line interface (CLI) in the `src/cli/` folder using Click.

1. **CLICommands Implementation**
   - Create a module named `cli_commands.py` in `src/cli/`.
   - Implement a class or a set of functions under the namespace `CLICommands` that provide the following commands:
     - `create_wallet`: Calls `MultisigWallet.create_wallet()`
     - `build_transaction`: Calls `TransactionBuilder.create_transaction()` and related methods
     - `sign_transaction`: Integrates device signing using the unified device interface
     - `broadcast_transaction`: Calls `TransactionBuilder.broadcast()`

### Prompt 9: Integrating Modules and Wiring Components Together

```text
# Prompt 9: Integrating Modules and Wiring Components Together

Now, wire all the previously implemented modules into a cohesive application.

1. **Main Application**
   - Create a main module (e.g., `main.py` in the root or `src/` folder).
   - In `main.py`, perform the following:
     - Initialize the configuration using `ConfigLoader` from `src/common/config_loader.py`.
     - Set up logging using `Logger` from `src/common/logger.py`.
     - Instantiate the Bitcoin Transaction Management components: `MultisigWallet`, `TransactionBuilder`, and `TransactionMonitor`.
     - Instantiate device modules as needed (e.g., create instances of `YubiKeyDevice`, `LedgerDevice`, and `HardcodedKeyDevice`).
     - Wire these components so that, for example, the CLI commands can trigger multisig wallet creation, transaction building, signing (via device integrations), broadcasting, and monitoring.
   - Ensure that error handling is consistent and that logging captures the entire lifecycle of operations.

2. **Testing the Integration**
   - Write integration tests (in appropriate test files) that simulate a full multisig transaction flow.
   - Verify that calling the CLI commands triggers the correct sequence of operations.

Confirm that the entire application can be run from the command line and that all modules are interacting as expected.

### Prompt 10: Building and Testing the Demo Module

```text
# Prompt 10: Building and Testing the Demo Module

Finally, create a demonstration script that shows the complete workflow of the multisig wallet.

1. **Demo Script**
   - In the `demo/` folder, create a script named `demo.py`.
   - Implement `demo.py` to perform the following:
     - Create a multisig wallet using `MultisigWallet`.
     - Build a multisig transaction using `TransactionBuilder`.
     - Invoke device signing through the unified device interface (collect signatures from YubiKey, LedgerDevice, and HardcodedKeyDevice).
     - Broadcast the transaction and initiate transaction monitoring with `TransactionMonitor`.
     - Output terminal logs that clearly indicate each step and the lifecycle events of the transaction.

2. **Testing the Demo**
   - Execute the demo script and ensure that all steps are functioning together.
   - Use logging and assertions (where appropriate) to validate that each step completed successfully.
   
Confirm that the demo provides a clear, end-to-end illustration of the multisig workflow, ready for presentation or further refinement.
